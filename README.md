The Bcd - Payment-QR-Code Projekt get the userInformation, saves them in the 
Bill Class and then sends all available User Payment Infos to the 
BilltoStringConverter Class which transforms the avaiable User Infos into a string
which is then given to the Qr-Generator Class which transforms the string into 
a 2d Qr Code, with this Qr-Code user can scan the Qr Code, therefore then they can
see what are they paying for and also redcues Typo-Error from Users.
